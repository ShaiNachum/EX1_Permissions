# EX1 - Permissions

## This Project Made During "Mobile Security" Course.

## Project Requirement:
  We were asked to produce an application with a simple login page containing a text field used as a password and a login button.
  The entry approval must be conditioned on certain parameters that must be obtained by reading from the Android device.

## Project Explenation:
  In the first activity I request necessary permissions to access the application.
  After the user approves all permissions (location permissions and access to contacts), he needs to enter a password which is the phone's battery level.
  
## The Features:
  * Register for activity result.
  * Check self permission.
  * Material alert dialog builder
  * Show request permission rationale.
  * Location Permissions - Fine and Coarse.
  * Background location.
  * Ask for read contacts permission.
  * Get accsess to battery level.
